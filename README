This repository is for learning assembly language programming, and other
things using the little computer 3 instruction set.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC-3

---------------------------------------------------------------------

This document is targetted toward average programmers.  C experience
is not specifically required, but enough general programming knowledge
to the point that you can read C programs is required as C will be used
as a bridge between your programming knowledge and assembly language
and the other topics discussed.

The tools are all written in C so the ability to compile and run them
is required.  They are written to be very portable and will hopefully
compile and run on your system.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

What assembly language is not:

Assembly language is not, generally, the language you use for device
drivers, nor is the primary language for bare metal program or other
forms of low level programming.  Mostly C is used for such things but
other languages work as well.  Yes some assembly is required for some
things, but it is way less than one percent of the overall code, in
general.   And yes some folks use it heavily for fun or to prove a point
or other reasons.

Assembly language is not a unversal language for all processors in the
sense that there is one assembly language and one instruction set.  This
instruction set should really not take more than an evening to learn for
an average programmer (any other language C, Python, whatever), the
things that might cause a hang up would/should cause a similar hang up
in any other language (C, Python, Java, whatever) like bitwise logical
operations.  Learning this lc-3 instruction set does not mean you can
then run off and program in assembly language for your phone or computer.
Those devices use a different instruction set and if you want to know
the assembly language for those you need to learn that separately.  The
good side of this is that each new instruction set you learn is much
easier than the last, much easier than learning multiple high level
languages (C, Python, Java, whatever).

Generally assembly languages are not standardized, what does conform
to a hard standard is the instruciton set, the machine code, the bits
that make the processor do things.  If there is more than one assembler
(the program, like a compiler, that converts the assembly language
source code into something lower level, usually machine code) for a
particular instruciton set, each author may choose to implement a
completely different "language" as in the keywords and other syntax
that make up the programming language.  The GNU assembler is well known
for messing up instruction sets.  In this case (lc-3) I am not going
to conform to the assembly language supported by the inventors text book.

What assembly language is:

Assembly language is a programming language like C or Python or Java.

Assembly language instructions generally attempt to have a one to one
relationship with machine code instructions.  Another way to say this
or think about this is that often a single line of assembly language
results in a single machine code instruction.  There are of course
exceptions, directives used to communicate something to the assembler.

High level languages C, Python, Java are converted from the text file
form into something lower using a compiler.  The term compiler is not
normally used for assembly language, instead the term assembler is used.
Unfortunately, it is not uncommon to see the term assembler used as a
reference to the language not the tool used to convert the language into
machine code.

The little computer 3, lc-3, is an educational instruction set, it is
certainly possible to turn it into hardware and do useful things with
it but it is better served as an educational tool.  A stepping stone
up to larger more complicated instruction sets.

This tutorial and repository will attempt to show you not only how to
get started in assembly language programming, but it will do this
by showing you the machine code, showing you at least one instruction
set simulator, an assembler and a disassembler.

Most of the assembly language lessons are delivered in a way where you
are expected to type them in yourself, assemble and run them with the
simulator and get the same results as the tutorial.  You of course could
cut and paste them instead of typing but then you leave a hole in your
education.  The typing and debugging side of programming using these
tools and this language.

You will need appendix A from this book:
